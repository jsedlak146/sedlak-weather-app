## Description

For this challenge, I had to design a 5 day weather forecasting application.  When a city was entered, the 5 day forecast for the city including temperature, wind speed and humidity would display in a box. Below are the links to my repository and my deployed page:

## Installation

To create the application, I began by building an HTML structure with everything necessary to complete the 5  displays, the search bar and the buttons.  Next, I used javascript and jquery along with a weather API to pull the data for the searched city and display it within it's respective card.

## Usage

To use the weather app, simply go to the empty search bar and enter any city you want to see the 5 day forecast for.  Click the search city button and the forecast will be displayed below in the cards.
